# SEPP
This repo is not production-ready yet. I am still developing the core features.

The SEPP (Security Edge Protection Proxy) is a critical security component in the 5G architecture. It protects inter-PLMN communication by securing messages exchanged between different mobile networks via IPX providers, handling encryption/decryption, signature verification, and policy enforcement.

SEPP is a Rust implementation of 3GPP's 5G SEPP specification. The specification can be found [here](https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3536) and [here](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/).
